# Google Voice Hat Experiment


I'm testing out the capabilities of the Google Voice Hat for the Raspberry Pi. I'm fairly satisfied with how I can use it 
for getting text from speech via the assistant API. I can catch the output and use the google_speech python module to build a response.
I personally like that module better than ``aiy.voice.say``, because it doesnt' sound **as** robotic.

## TODO

    * Map Goodreads API so it tells me if I have a certain book already.
    * Map reddit api so it can tell me if a new One Piece chapter is out based on /r/onepiece's usual post.
    * Use it with Tasker to greet anyone who connects to the Wifi.
